# Intel_hackathon

## Overview
The **Intel_hackathon** repository contains two main projects: the **Job Description Skill Extractor** and the **Employee Attrition Prediction Model**. Both tools leverage Python and natural language processing techniques to provide valuable insights for job seekers and organizations.

### Job Description Skill Extractor
The **Job Description Skill Extractor** is designed to analyze job descriptions and extract relevant skills associated with specific job titles. This project aims to help job seekers identify the key skills required for various roles, enhancing their understanding of job market demands.

### Employee Attrition Prediction Model
The **Employee Attrition Prediction Model** aims to predict employee attrition using a Random Forest Classifier. By analyzing various employee attributes, this model helps organizations identify employees at risk of leaving, enabling proactive measures to enhance employee retention.
